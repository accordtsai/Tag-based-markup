Specifications and hints to implementing the import filter system

We will import data from 3 different sources: 
EMR: Physician-written notes and orders
HIS: Lab values and report system
PACS: DICOM-based images

The images of the PACS system will often have an accompanying entry in the HIS system. Duplication is not necessary, and we will ignore the PACS entry unless there is no corresponding HIS entry (i.e. image-only and no report).

== EMR ==

High-level explanation of what we do:

import_encounters:

Using URL: http://hisweb.hosp.ncku/Emrquery/tree/list.aspx?chartno=00000000&start=2000/1/1&stop=2014-05-13&query=0
¡÷ Returns tree with listing of inpatient & outpatient visits
¡÷ <li id='emr'>
¡÷ Extract all top-level OPD and admission records, and corresponding links for EMR viewing

import_soap:

Link to individual encounters
¡÷ Download individual encounter data
¡÷ Parse into SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment, plan)
